This directory contains numerous example models using DIESEL:

NEURAL MODELS:

BRK:  2-compartment model of a motoneuron from Booth, Rinzel, and Kiehn 1997.

FN:  Fitzhugh-Nagumo model of neuronal activity.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitzHugh%E2%80%93Nagumo_model

HH:  Classic Hodgkin-Huxley model of squid giant axon.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model

MRG:  Model of a mammalian nerve fiber.  Adapted from McIntyre, Richardson, and Crill, 2001

QuadIandF: Quadratic Integrate and Fire neuron.  Adapted from Izhikevich, E.M., Simple Model of Spiking Neurons, IEEE Trans on Neural Networks, Nov 2003

HN:  Model of the leech heart interneuron from Hill et. al, 2001.  Demonstrates how a network of different neurons can be constructed in DSL.

PD:  A model of the pyloric dialator neuron in the lobster STG, as used in Prinz. et al 2003.

tutorial:  tutorial of a simple spiking neuron model and two-cell network used in the simEngine getting started guide.

SYSTEMS BIOLOGY MODELS:
