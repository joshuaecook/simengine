classdef IClamp < Model
% IClamp - current clamp point process for a Neuron model
% 
% IClamp Properties:
%   del - deletion time before the current clamp begins
%   dur - duration of the curent clamp
%   amp - amplitude of the current clamp
%
%  The Neuron syntax and semantics are based on the NEURON Simulator by
%  N.T. Carnevale and M.L. Hines at Yale University (www.neuron.yale.edu).
