OpenGL-Accelerated Visualization of GPU Computing

Requires an Nvidia Tesla and another high-end, OpenGL-capable video card.

Illustrates a sampling of the outputs of 100 parallel STG neuron
simulations. (More than this number are possible, but changing the
number of models currently requires recompilation.) Demonstrates
repetitive firing and other activity patterns of the model neuron and
shows the effect of varying the simulation parameters.

Usage:

Review the first few lines of Makefile and ensure that `base'
refers to the simEngine installation path and that `CUDA_SDK_PATH'
names the Nvidia CUDA SDK installation path. (The Nvidia paths are
known to change between minor versions.)

Compile with `make' and then run `./cuda_glui' with command-line
parameters naming its input files. Each input file must contain a
line for each of the parallel models (100 lines) and a column for
each input in decimal format. The files `states.dat' and `clut.dat'
are read in the initialize the model initial states and the color
lookup table, respectively.

The animation will appear in a new window and display each file of
inputs for 10 seconds of simulated time. Press the escape key on the
keyboard to exit the demonstration.
