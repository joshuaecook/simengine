How to install the Functional Graph Library (FGL)



Change to the "src" subdirectory, and make sure that the following 
files are present:

  applic/
    build.sml
    clique.sml
    dfs.sml
    indep.sml
    lamtr.sml
    paths.sml
    red.sml
    rev.sml
  gr.sig  
  gr.sml
  gr_ab.sml
  gr_as.sml
  gr_t.sml
  sources.cm
  util/
    funarray/
       array.sig
       carray.sml
       sources.cm
    general.sml
    int-binary-map.sml
    list.sml
    ord-map-sig.sml
    sources.cm
    sparseset.sml
    tuple.sml

The contents of the files and their relationships are explained
a little bit in the file src/sources.cm.


The current version of FGL assumes that you have SML of New Jersey 
installed together with the following options: 
  
  (1)  The Compilation Manager (CM)
  (2)  The SML/NJ Library (smlnj-lib.cm is referenced in src/sources.cm)


In that case you can start SML/NJ in the directory src and enter
on the top-level

  CM.make();
  
Then all the library files will be compiled, and can be used
afterwards.
